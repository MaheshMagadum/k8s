Example Traffic Flow:An external user makes a request from the External Network (e.g., via a browser or API).If the service is of type LoadBalancer or NodePort, the request enters the cluster via the load balancer or node port.The service routes the request to the appropriate Pods using its ClusterIP, with the Kube Proxy forwarding the traffic to the specific Pods based on the current Pod status.The Pod processes the request, and the response is sent back to the user through the same path.
