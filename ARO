ARO:

Nodes: The actual machines (master or worker) that run workloads or control plane services in the OpenShift cluster.

Machines: Representations of the virtual machines on which the nodes run, managed by the OpenShift Machine API.

MachineSets: Templates used to scale machines automatically by defining how many machines of a certain type should be created.

In short, MachineSets manage Machines, which in turn correspond to Nodes in the ARO cluster.
