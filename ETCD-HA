Internal Synchronization Mechanisms:

The API servers, controller-managers, and schedulers all rely on the following internal synchronization mechanisms:

etcd as a consistent data store.Leader election for active components like the controller-manager and scheduler.

Load balancing for the API server to distribute requests and ensure availability.

Leader election using Raft algorithm for etcd

Odd number of master nodes should be used as quorum. ex: quorum of 3 is 2 and quorum of 5 is 3
